# rvanimations
*Some Animations I developed during  the summer of 2015.*

##I made these animations to be used in the front while the main page loads up. 

I made two animations using jQuery and CSS and ofcourse HTML.
* `One was an "excavation animation" where a backhoe clears the sand off the screen for the main page.`
* `The second one was an "construction animation" where bricks start building up from the bottom and then clear up for the main page.`
